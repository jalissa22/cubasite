      For our trip we primary visited Old Town Havana but we did take a day trip out to Viñales Valley and the beach another day. We booked a tour through AirBnB that was really interesting. The guide will pick you up at your AirBnB and take you to multiple places. We saw a tobacco farm, the Mural de la Prehistoria in Viñales Valley and also ate at an authentic Cuban resturant. Keep in mind it's about a 2 1/2 hour drive out of town if you're staying near Miramar or Havana.

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Tobacco Farm Tour</p>
      <p class="text-left">The Tobacco Farm is family owned and they sell their own cigars and homemade rum. The tour gives you a brief look into the process of growing the tobacco and making the cigars which is very interesting. </p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Beach</p>
      <p class="text-left">We met a nice taxi driver that was able to recommend a beach that was less crowded- Playa Santa Maria Del Mar. The beach had full service with chairs and umbrellas to rent for $1 CUC. They also had a waiter out there that would take food and drink orders and bring them out to you.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Old Town Havana</p>
      <p class="text-left">Old Town is a must see when visiting Cuba. This is where you'll find all the museums and some historical resturants. The city capital is also in Old town and the colorful buildings that most people take pictures in front of are here.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Viñales Valley</p>
      <p class="text-left">Mural de la Prehistoria in the Viñales Valley was part of the tobacco farm tour because they are in the same area. It's an interesting stop to see this giant mural that was painted in 1961. They also had the best piña colada at this little hut at the site.</p>
