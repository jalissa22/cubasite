      <p class="font-weight-bold title">12 Categories</p>
      <p class="text-left">To travel to Cuba legally, you would need to fall under one of the 12 categories the United States government has established. For us, we traveled under "Support for the Cuban People" which meant that our itinerary had to reflect us staying in an Airbnb (not a hotel) and engaging with the local people daily (not laying on the beach everyday.) For this we booked a tour to see a local tobacco farm.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Visa's</p>
      <p class="text-left">You'll also need to purchase a Visa to visit the country. The site we used is <a href="https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a>. The ticket itself is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was placed, I received the Visa's within 2 business days but don't push your luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains errors.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Taxi's</p>
      <p class="text-left">When landing you should have no problem finding a taxi, there's dozens of them waiting to pick up people. Make sure you've converted enough cash at the airport to pay for a taxi into town. Negotiating a price is possible, but easier if you speak spanish. We were able to negotiate a trip from the airport to our AirBnB in Miramar for $40. <br>There are also 3 kinds of Taxis in Cuba. 1) Yellow Cabs: Newer nice cars driven by legal licensed drivers 2) Classic Cabs: 1950's cars licensed to be taxis but they are more expensive 3) Non-licensed taxi drivers- These are regular Cuban people who will offer you rides for cheap. <br>The Classic Cabs are nice to do at least once while you're in Cuba but I wouldn't recommend it for the trip from the airport (that would be an expensive ride!). Although it might be appealing to accept a ride from a non-licensed taxi driver because they are really cheap, I would suggest against it. There's no way to know if they are responsible drivers or criminals.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Cuban Customs</p>
      <p class="text-left">Cuban Customs is what I was most worried about but it was a breeze. Going in you just need to have your Visa filled out and on the plane and you'll also receive a declorations paper that you'll have to turn in with your Visa when exiting the airport. Customs was fast, they only asked my name and confirmed my passport. When leaving the country the taxi driver suggested we get there early, so we got there 3 hours early.  Although it only took less than 30 minutes to go through their customs line. </p>
