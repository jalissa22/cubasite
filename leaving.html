    <p class="p-5">
      Traveling can be stressful, especially when going to a country with government restrictions. <br>Here's a couple of tips to help you! 
    </p>

<div class="container p-3">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
     <img src="images/7.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" alt="List that shows 12 categories for traveling in Cuba">
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p class="font-weight-bold">12 Categories</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">To travel to Cuba legally, you would need to fall under one of the 12 categories the United States government has established. For us, we traveled under "Support for the Cuban People" which meant that our itinerary had to reflect us staying in an Airbnb (not a hotel) and engaging with the local people daily (not laying on the beach everyday) For this we booked a tour to see a local tobacco farm.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <img src="images/8.jpeg" class="img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" alt="Example of Cuban Visa">
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p class="font-weight-bold">Visa's</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">You'll also need to purchase a Visa to visit the country. The site we used is <a href="https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a> The ticket it's self is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was placed, I received the Visa's within 2 business days but don't push you're luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains an error.</p>

   <div class="col-sm">
      <img src="images/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-lg mt-5" alt="Taxis at an airport">
      <img src="images/12.jpeg" class="img-fluid mt-4 rounded-lg" alt="Two women leaning against car doors">
      <img src="images/11.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-4 rounded-lg" alt="Classic 1950's car">
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p class="font-weight-bold">Taxi's</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">When landing you should have no problem finding a taxi, there is dozens of them waiting to pick up tourists. Make sure you've converted enough cash at the airport to pay for a taxi into town. Negotiating a price is possible, but easier if you speak spanish. We were able to negotiate a trip from the airport to our AirBnB in Miramar for $40. <br>There are also 3 kinds of Taxis in Cuba. 1) Yellow Cabs: Newer nice cars driven by legal licensed drivers 2) Classic Cabs: 1950's cars licensed to be taxis but they are more expensive 3) Non licensed taxi drivers- These are regular Cuban people who will offer you rides for cheap. <br>The Classic Cabs are nice to do at least once while you're in Cuba but I wouldn't recommend it for the trip from the airport (that would be an expensive ride!). Although it might be appealing to accept a ride from a non licensed taxi driver because they are really cheap, I would suggest against it. There's no way to know if they are responsible drivers or criminals.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p class="font-weight-bold">Cuban Customs</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Cuban Customs is what I was most worried about but it was a breeze. Going in you just need to have your Visa filled out and on the plane you'll also receive a declorations paper that you'll have to turn in with your Visa when exiting the airport. Customs was fast, they only asked my name and confirmed my passport. When leaving Cuba the taxi driver suggested we get there early, so we got there 3 hours early and it only took less than 30 minutes to go through their customs line.</p>
