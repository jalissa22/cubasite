      <div class="col-sm"><img alt=
      "List that shows 12 categories for traveling in Cuba" class=
      "img-fluid mt-3 rounded-lg" src="images/12cat.png">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">12 Categories</p>


        <p class="text-left">To travel to Cuba legally, you would need to fall
        under one of the 12 categories the United States government has
        established. For us, we traveled under "Support for the Cuban People" which
        meant that our itinerary had to reflect us staying in an Airbnb (not a
        hotel) and engaging with the local people daily (not laying on the beach
        everyday.) For this we booked a tour to see a local tobacco farm.</p>

        <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
          <p class="font-weight-bold title">Visa's</p>


          <p class="text-left">You'll also need to purchase a Visa to visit the
          country. The site we used is <a href=
          "https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a>. The ticket
          itself is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was
          placed, I received the Visa within 2 business days but don't push your
          luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not
          to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains
          errors.</p>

        <div class="col-sm"><img alt="Classic 1950's car" class=
        "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/11.jpg">
        </div>


        <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
          <p class="font-weight-bold title">Taxi's</p>


          <p class="text-left">When landing you should have no problem finding a
          taxi, there's dozens of them waiting to pick up people. Make sure you've
          converted enough cash at the airport to pay for a taxi into town.
          Negotiating a price is possible, but easier if you speak spanish. We were
          able to negotiate a trip from the airport to our AirBnB in Miramar for
          $40.<br>
          There are also 3 kinds of Taxis in Cuba. 1) Yellow Cabs: Newer nice cars
          driven by legal licensed drivers 2) Classic Cabs: 1950's cars licensed to
          be taxis but they are more expensive 3) Non-licensed taxi drivers- These
          are regular Cuban people who will offer you rides for cheap.<br>
          The Classic Cabs are nice to do at least once while you're in Cuba but I
          wouldn't recommend it for the trip from the airport (that would be an
          expensive ride!). Although it might be appealing to accept a ride from a
          non-licensed taxi driver because they are really cheap, I would suggest
          against it. There's no way to know if they are responsible drivers or
          criminals.</p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold title">Cuban Customs</p>


            <p class="text-left">Cuban Customs is what I was most worried about but
            it was a breeze. The taxi driver suggested we get there early, so we got
            there 3 hours early. But for us it took less than 30 minutes to go
            through their line. This could have been a rare occurance, so still be
            cautious of time. If you're early no problem! Hang out in the airport and
            buy those last minute bottles of Rum- Duty Free!</p>
