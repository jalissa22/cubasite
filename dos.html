The site we used is <a href="https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a> The ticket it's self is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was placed, I received the Visa's within 2 business days but don't push you're luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains an error.</p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">When landing you should have no problem finding a taxi, there is dozens of them waiting to pick up tourists. Make sure you've converted enough cash at the airport to pay for a taxi into town. Negotiating a price is possible, but easier if you speak spanish. We were able to negotiate a trip from the airport to our AirBnB in Miramar for $40. <br>There are also 3 kinds of Taxis in Cuba. 1) Yellow Cabs: Newer nice cars driven by legal licensed drivers 2) Classic Cabs: 1950's cars licensed to be taxis but they are more expensive 3) Non licensed taxi drivers- These are regular Cuban people who will offer you rides for cheap. <br>The Classic Cabs are nice to do at least once while you're in Cuba but I wouldn't recommend it for the trip from the airport (that would be an expensive ride!). Although it might be appealing to accept a ride from a non licensed taxi driver because they are really cheap, I would suggest against it. There's no way to know if they are responsible drivers or criminals.</p>
