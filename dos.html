     Every person is different and I'm not here to tell you what you can and cannot do. But from my experience in Cuba these were the little things I picked up on. Maybe some of these tips will come in handy for you.

        <span>Here's some tips!</span>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>
      <p class="text-left">Know some spanish! It would be ideal to bring a translator with you, someone who speaks spanish. But if that's not an option, have a book that you can look up or speak a few sentences. Because Cuba and the US don't have an amazing relationship, hardly any locals speak English.</p>

    <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>
      <p class="text-left">Don't carry all of your cash with you when you go out. It would be smart to only take what you'll need for the day and maybe a little more as a cushion. Since you're not able to pull more money out of an ATM if anything were to happen you'd be in a difficult situation. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>
      <p class="text-left">Ask taxi drivers or waiters for recommendations. They should know the area very well and could give you inside tips into their favorite beaches or hang out spots. They are also very friendly and eager to speak to tourists.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>
      <p class="text-left">Don't get stuck in a Wifi hotspot. It's easy to loose track of time when you finally find a place that has internet. When checking emails or uploading to Instagram, an hour can pass by like minutes and that's now less time you have exploring. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>
      <p class="text-left">Negotiate prices. Street vendors and Taxi drivers are usually always willing to negotiate on their prices. Don't completely low ball them on everything but if you ask to be taken from Old Town Havana back to your hotel and they say $20, it never hurts to ask if they'd take you for $15. Most of the time we got the discount.</p>

    <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>
      <p class="text-left">Don't forget to bring any travel sized items you'll need like Tums, moist wipes, or ibuprofen. Since most of the markets are limited in items and brands it will be a little difficult for you to find the small toiletry items. </p>
