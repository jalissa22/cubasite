  <p class="p-3 pb-5 lead">Every person is different and I'm not here to tell
  you what you can and cannot do. But from my experience in Cuba these were the
  little things I picked up on. Maybe some of these tips will come in handy for
  you.</p>


  <p class="p-0">

  <h4><span>Here are some tips!</span>
  </h4>
  <p></p>

  <div class="container p-3">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm"><img alt="Basic Spanish for DUMMIES book cover" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/42.png">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>


        <p class="text-left">Know some Spanish! It would be ideal to bring a
        translator with you or someone who speaks spanish. But if that's not an
        option, have a book that you can look up or speak a few sentences. Since
        Cuba and the US don't have an amazing relationship, hardly any locals speak
        English.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm"><img alt=
      "Tracy Morgan sitting in chair with suit of money on" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/45.png">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>


        <p class="text-left">Don't carry all of your cash with you when you go out.
        It would be smart to only take what you'll need for the day and maybe a
        little more as a cushion. Since you're not able to pull more money out of
        an ATM if anything were to happen, you'd be in a difficult situation.</p>

  <div class="container p-3">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm"><img alt=
      "Inside back shot of passenger talking to Taxi driver" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/43.jpeg">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>


        <p class="text-left">Ask taxi drivers or waiters for recommendations. They
        should know the area very well and could give you inside tips into their
        favorite beaches or hang out spots. They are also very friendly and eager
        to speak to tourists.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm"><img alt=
      "Close up of iPhone screen with social media apps" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/24.jpg">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>


        <p class="text-left">Don't get stuck in a Wifi hotspot. It's easy to loose
        track of time when you finally find a place that has internet. When
        checking emails or uploading to Instagram, an hour can pass by like minutes
        and that's now less time you have exploring.</p>

  <div class="container p-3">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm"><img alt="People walking through an outside market"
      class="img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/44.png">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Do</p>


        <p class="text-left">Negotiate prices. Street vendors and Taxi drivers are
        usually always willing to negotiate on their prices. Don't completely low
        ball them on everything but if you ask to be taken from Old Town Havana
        back to your hotel and they say $20, it never hurts to ask if they'd take
        you for $15. Most of the time we got the discount.</p>

      <div class="col-sm"><img alt="Example of toiletries" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/46.jpg">
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Don't</p>


        <p class="text-left">Don't forget to bring any travel sized items you'll
        need like Tums, moist wipes, or ibuprofen. Since most of the markets are
        limited in items and brands it will be a little difficult for you to find
        the small toiletry items.</p>
