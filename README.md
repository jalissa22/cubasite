# CubaSite

Thank you for visiting my site.<br>
About 2 months ago I was invited to take a trip to Cuba with some family friends. Of course I jumped at the opprotunity to go and see this country that seemed to be frozen in time. I've traveled to different states in the United States and a couple of countries in Europe but Cuba was something else. Since the Cold War, Cuba has been a sort of illegal vacation destination for Americans. Although it's not entirely legal to go there as an American tourist, it is possible. The thought of following American restrictions is a little daunting so I felt that I should share my experience as an American traveling to Cuba. I've also encluded some tips that I hope are helpful, even in the slightest.
