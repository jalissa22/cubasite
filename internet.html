<p class="p-3 pb-5 lead">
      You aren't going to find a 24 hour CVS here. There is no Uber or Lyft that you can summon rides at your finger tips. There is no GrubHub, Eat24, PostMates, or UberEats. All the everyday conviences that we don't think twice about are not available in Cuba. But that's the part of the experiance when visiting a country like Cuba!

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Wifi</p>
      <p class="text-left">The internet is controlled by the government. In order to use Wifi you'll need to purchase an internet card. They are only $1 for 1 hour use but you can only purchase them at special locations or markets in town. When you purchase a card you'll need to present your passport. Additionally, you can only access the internet in specific locations like bars, hotel lobbies, or movie theaters. Once you get your card, you'll have to find a wifi hotspot and log on using the numbers on the back of the card. You'll usually be able to recognize hot spot's because there will be a crowd of people gathered on their phones. It's kind of funny to see.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Markets</p>
      <p class="text-left">The options at all the markets are super limited. Trade is regulated by the governments so small markets don't have unique items or options. When visiting a market in Miramar, they carried the same brand for different products. For example, the same people who made their shampoo would also make toothpaste. The stores were organized and clean but the shelfs weren't full. It looked like a market in a town that was about to get hit by a hurricane. Also be aware that the small markets don't stay open late, so if you're hungry make sure to get food before the evening.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold title">Toilets</p>
      <p class="text-left">Are really gross. Most of them don't have toilet seats and you're lucky if you find toilet paper. NEVER FLUSH THE PAPER. The pipes in Cuba are really bad and toilet paper will make the toilets clog. One thing I noticed is the super tourist places always have clogged toilets because the tourists don't realize.</p>
