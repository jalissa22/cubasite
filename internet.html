      <p class="paragraphtext">The internet is controlled by the government. In order to use Wifi you'll need to purchase an internet card. They are only $1 for 1 hour use but you can only purchase them at special locations or markets in town. When you purchase a card you'll need to present you passport. Additionally, you can only access the internet in specific locations, like bars or movie theaters. Once you get your card, you'll have to find a wifi hotspot and log on using the numbers on the back of the card. You'll usually be able to recognize hot spot's because there will be a crowd of people gathered on their phones. </p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">You'll also need to purchase a Visa to visit the country. The site we used is <a href="https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a> The ticket it's self is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was placed, I received the Visa's within 2 business days but don't push you're luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains an error.</p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">The options at all the markets are super limited. When visiting a market in Miramar, they only had 1 brand of their products and only 1 type of cereal. Trade is regulated by the governments so small markets don't have unique items or options.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold">Toilets</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Are really gross. Most of them don't have toilet seats and you're lucky if you find toilet paper. NEVER FLUSH THE PAPER. The pipes in Cuba are really bad and toilet paper will make the toilets clog. One thing I noticed is the super tourist places always have clogged toilets because the tourists don't realize.</p>
