  <p class="p-3 pb-5 lead">American money or American Credit Cards do not work
  here! You'll need to convert some American dollars into Cuban dollars for
  however long your stay will be. It's important to stick to your budget because
  once your money runs out you will not be able to pull more out at an ATM.</p>

  <h4><span>Here are some tips!</span>

      <div class="col-sm"><img alt="Cuban Convertible Peso" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/13.jpg"> <img alt=
      "Cuban Convertible Peso single bill" class="img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src=

        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Cuban Convertible Peso<br>
        CUC</p>


        <p class="text-left">The CUC is currency used by the tourists. The
        conversion on this currency is 1:1 which means if you buy a drink that is
        $3 USD it will be $3 CUC. An easy way to know which is CUC or CUP is CUC is
        marked with monuments.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="col-sm"><img alt="Example of CUP cuban currency" class=
      "img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src="images/15.jpg"> <img alt=
      "Example of CUP cuban currency" class="img-fluid mt-5 rounded-lg" src=

      <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0 mt-lg-0">
        <p class="font-weight-bold title">The Cuban Peso<br>
        CUP</p>


        <p class="text-left">The CUP is currency used by the locals. This
        conversion is 1:26.5 which means that if you buy a drink for $3 USD it will
        come out to $79.50 CUP. Any easy way to spot CUP is they will have Iconic
        Figures on them like this $3 CUP example with Che. When purchasing anything
        that requires change back, make sure they give you the currency you paid
        with. There are locals that will try to give you back CUP when you've paid
        CUC. If this happens, it means they shorted you money.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold title">Converting Money</p>


        <p class="text-left">Converting money for your trip is very important.
        You'll need to bring enough American dollars to last you for your whole
        vacation because once you land in Cuba, there is no pulling money out from
        the banks. The conversion is taxed 3% but Americans also have an extra 10%
        tax on top of that. So if you convert $100 USD you will only get back $87
        CUC. You're able to convert cash at the airport, hotels, or banks.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold title">American Credit Cards</p>


        <p class="text-left">There are no American Credit Cards accepted in Cuba.
        If you booked your Airbnb or hotel with a credit card they should have been
        able to process the order online. I would suggest booking as many
        activities online as you can before you make it out to Cuba.</p>
