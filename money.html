    <p class="p-5">
      American Money or American Credit Cards do not work here!
      You'll need to convert some American dollars into Cuban dollars for however long your stay will be. It's important to stick to your budget because once your money runs out you will not be able to pull more out at an ATM.

      <p class="paragraphtext">To travel to Cuba legally, you would need to fall under one of the 12 categories the United States government has established. For us, we traveled under "Support for the Cuban People" which meant that our itinerary had to reflect us staying in an Airbnb (not a hotel) and engaging with the local people daily (not laying on the beach everyday) For this we booked a tour to see a local tobacco farm.</p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">You'll also need to purchase a Visa to visit the country. The site we used is <a href="https://cubavisaservices.com/">CubaVisaServices.com</a> The ticket it's self is $85 each plus a $25 standard shipping fee. Once the order was placed, I received the Visa's within 2 business days but don't push you're luck- I would get these ASAP. Filling them out is easy but be careful not to mess up! You will have to purchase another Visa if yours contains an error.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold">American Credit Cards</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">There are no American Credit Cards accepted in Cuba. International Credit Cards are the only ones that will work. So if you have a Credit Card from a Canadian bank or another international bank that would be good to bring. If you booked your Airbnb or hotel with a credit card they should have been able to process the order online. I would suggest booking as many activities online as you can before you make it out to Cuba. </p>
