  <p class="p-3 pb-5 lead lead">Having food restrictions might not make me the
  best candidate for food recommendations unless you're gluten free and lactose
  free- then I'm your gal! Since their trade is limited, most places have
  limited options when it comes to serving gluten free foods. There was no
  gluten free bread or pasta replacements. Most resturants weren't "Gluten Free
  Friendly" but I was still able to find food options to eat. It was safe for me
  to stick to chicken and veggies. Additionally, some of the drinks like Piña
  Coladas had powered milk mixed into it. I had the translator ask about my food
  allergies before taking a bite or drink of anything just to be safe.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold title">What to Expect</p>


        <p class="text-left">It's similar to Mexican food but more tropical. For
        example, a typical menu will have pork with tropical sauce, lobster with
        tropical sauce, or shrimp in tropical sauce. And the breakfast had more
        tropical fruits like papya, pineapple, and guava. Traditional sides include
        white rice and black beans- almost every meal we ate came with white rice
        and black beans. The food is definitely cheaper here but the portions are a
        little smaller.</p>

            <p class="text-left">Rum flows like water in Cuba with their main selling
            company being Havana Club. The most popular drinks are Cuba Librés (rum &
            coke) and Mojitos. Drinks are ridiculously cheap here with a mojito being
            about $3-5 CUC. For water, I only stuck to bottled which was available at
            every resturant. If you go to the beach I suggest trying a fresh coconut
            with rum! They were only $3 CUC and super delicious.</p>
